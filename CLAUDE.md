# prisma-postgres-skill

This is an AI coding skill plugin. It contains no application code — only markdown skill files and platform manifests.

## When editing skills

- Every skill has a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and markdown body.
- The `description` field controls when the skill is triggered. Keep trigger keywords specific and accurate.
- Skills are opinionated. Do not add hedging language, "it depends" qualifiers, or alternative approaches. Each skill states a position and enforces it.
- Use "Correct" / "Incorrect" sections with code examples, not prose explanations of tradeoffs.
- Keep examples concrete (real table names, real field names) not abstract (TableA, fieldX).

## When adding a new skill

1. Create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter.
2. Update the routing table in `skills/prisma-postgres/SKILL.md`.
3. Bump version in `package.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, and `gemini-extension.json`.
4. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Versioning

All six manifest files must have the same version string. When bumping, update all of them.
